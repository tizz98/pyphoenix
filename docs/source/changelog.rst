[0.2.0] - 2025-08-13
--------------------

**ðŸŽ‰ Phase 2 Complete: Integration & Core Features**

Added
~~~~~

**Phoenix App Integration**
* Phoenix app class routes WebSocket connections to registered channels
* Channel pattern matching (``room:*`` â†’ RoomChannel) working  
* WebSocket transport integrated with Phoenix application
* Complete routing from WebSocket â†’ Phoenix â†’ Channels

**End-to-End Functionality**
* Working client-server examples with real communication
* Complete channel join/leave flows between client and server
* Message broadcasting working across multiple connections

**Core Feature Implementation**
* PubSub integration with channel broadcasting (``channel.broadcast()``)
* Presence tracking methods (``track_presence()``, ``list_presence()``, ``broadcast_from()``)
* Comprehensive test suite with **71 passing tests**

**Developer Experience**  
* Working examples: ``target_chat_server.py`` and ``target_chat_client.py``
* Phoenix-style decorator API (``@app.channel("room:*")``)
* Robust error handling and socket cleanup

Fixed
~~~~~

**Socket & Channel Cleanup**
* Resolved double-leave issues and WebSocket close errors
* Fixed socket state management to prevent sending on closed sockets
* Added proper cleanup coordination between Socket and Channel

**Client Compatibility**
* Fixed join response handling and decorator patterns
* Updated client join response format expectations
* Corrected response format in ``_handle_reply()``

**Missing Implementation**
* Implemented ``track_presence()``, ``list_presence()``, ``broadcast_from()`` methods
* Added comprehensive presence method tests
* Fixed websocket library compatibility with modern websockets.asyncio API
